                    We encourage all members of the Code4Lib community to submit a proposal for a prepared talk. Prepared
                    talks should focus on one or more of the following areas:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Projects you've worked on which incorporate innovative implementation of existing technologies and/or development of new software</li>
                    <li>Tools and technologies – How to get the most out of existing tools, standards, and protocols (and ideas on how to make them better)</li>
                    <li>Technical issues – Big issues in library technology that are worthy of community attention or development</li>
                    <li>Relevant non-technical issues – Concerns of interest to the Code4Lib community which are not strictly technical in nature, e.g. collaboration, diversity, organizational challenges, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                    This year, in order to provide increased opportunities for a diversity of speakers and topics, we'll be
                    soliciting 10, 15, and 20 minute talks. You'll be asked to indicate which talk lengths you would be
                    willing to accommodate for your proposal. We are also considering holding a poster session at this year's conference.
                    If you would be interested in presenting your topic as a poster, please indicate so on
                    <a href="{{ site.data.conf.talk-proposal-form }}">the form</a>.
                </p>

                    In addition to "traditional" presentations and posters, we plan to include a panel session this year.
                    If you have a topic you'd like to suggest for a panel, and are willing to work with the Program
                    Committee to organize / recruit for the session, please use
                    <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/q2KbVcO4ntkh6bPp1">the Panel Submission form</a>.

                <h3>Selection Process</h3>
                <p>
                    As in past years, the Code4Lib community will vote on proposals that they would like to see included
                    in the program. The top 10 proposals are guaranteed a slot of their preferred length at the conference.
                    The Program Committee will curate the remainder of the program in an effort to ensure diversity in
                    program content and presenters. Community votes will, of course, still weigh heavily in these decisions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Presenters whose proposals are selected for inclusion in the program will have conference registration
                    slots held for them (up to 2 speakers per talk). In addition, panel participants will have registration slots
                    held. The standard conference registration fee will apply.
                </p>

                <!--<p>
                    Proposals can be submitted through November 7, 2016 at midnight PST (GMT−8). Voting will start on
                    November 16, 2016 and continue through December 7, 2016. The <abbr title="uniform resource locator">URL</abbr>
                    to submit votes will be announced on the Code4Lib website and mailing list and will
                    require an active <a href="http://code4lib.org/user/register">code4lib.org</a> account to participate.
                    The final list of presentations will be announced in December.
                </p>-->
