slies: https://osf.io/7gd5t/ 
---
<p>
  Does your library have important analytics you would like to share with others but you are not sure where to begin? Do you have existing reports you would like to compare to reveal patterns, trends, and associations but they are in different formats? This presentation shows a unique approach to managing your library’s big data using free online tools to create an analytics hub that breaks down the traditional silo approach to reports. In addition, you will learn how to publish the results online as real-time charts or as inline text within your current website. The best part? You can do it within an hour with little to no programming skills! Get hands-on with your library's big data, more effectively manage content on the web, and learn how to collaborate on live website content using Google Drive.
