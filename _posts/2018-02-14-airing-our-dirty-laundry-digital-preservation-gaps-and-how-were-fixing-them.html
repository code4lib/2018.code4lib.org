title: "Airing our Dirty Laundry: Digital Preservation Gaps and How We're Fixing Them"
---
<p>
  Objects in the Stanford Digital Repository are versioned and backed up, but our object recovery process has been … challenging.  Our digital preservation processes are optimized for “write once; read never."  To address our digital preservation gaps, we are creating a proactive audit process for preserved data and we are completely revamping how we back up and archive our digital content (for better long term preservation and easier recovery).  We are also implementing better ways to get at status information about our archived digital content.   We’ll present details about our preservation gaps and the solutions (which should all be in place by Code4Lib 2018), including how we're leveraging the cloud.
