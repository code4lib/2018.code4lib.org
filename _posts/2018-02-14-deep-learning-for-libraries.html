title: Deep Learning for Libraries
---
<p>
  Learn how to leverage open source tools like Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Tensor Flow/Keras to develop machine learning frameworks for your library. We’ll share simple workflows that we have developed to combine sensor data from access control gates, computer visions systems, and data science methods to develop predictive models for library space assessment. We’ll cover the specific hardware and software tools we used, share data visualizations, and explore how to move from data collection to actionable insights.
