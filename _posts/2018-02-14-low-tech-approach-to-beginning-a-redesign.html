title: Low Tech Approach to Beginning a Redesign
---
<p>
  "When redesigning a website, it’s important to make sure the content is what the audience wants. Recently, we decided to refresh the homepage at our academic library, and wanted to start with the question “what do students actually want to see on the homepage?”. An incredibly low-tech, low cost UX test commenced and was fantastically successful. We learned a lot from the students that were surveyed, and the results ended up driving the homepage’s refresh.
In this presentation, the UX test will be described along with the ways in which it guided the redesign process. How we got the students to help us out with very little publicity or effort on our part will also be explained. "
