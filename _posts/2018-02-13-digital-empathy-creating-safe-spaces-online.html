User research is often focused on measures of the usability of online spaces. We look at search traffic, run card sorting and usability testing activities, and track how users navigate our spaces. Those results inform design decisions through the lens of information architecture. This is important, but doesn't encompass everything a user needs in a space.
 <p>
 This workshop will focus on the other component of user experience design and user research: how to create spaces where users feel safe. Users bring their anxieties and stressors with them to our online spaces, but informed design choices can help to ameliorate that stress. This will ultimately lead to a more positive interaction between your institution and your users.
 <p>
 The presenters will discuss the theory behind empathetic design, delve deeply into using ethnographic research methods - including an opportunity for attendees to practice those ethnographic skills with student participants - and finish with the practical application of these results to ongoing and future projects.
