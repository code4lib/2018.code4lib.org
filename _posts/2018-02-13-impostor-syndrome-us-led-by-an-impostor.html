<p>Impostor syndrome is a drag. You think you aren't good enough to do what you do, even if there's a wealth of information refuting that. Maybe you feel lost, alone, and afraid while doing specific parts of your job. If this is a thing that feels familiar to you, come to this workshop! We'll get some group therapy in, I'll tell you some sweet (read: terrifying) stories from my own professional experience, and I'll give you some great resources for battling that "I should be quiet in the corner" mentality.</p>

<p>Am I qualified to lead this workshop? Probably not (I struggle with this every day), but I also think there should be something for people like us at every professional conference.</p>

<p>You'll learn:</p>
<ol>
<li>What impostor syndrome really is and how it affects your life and work.</li>
<li>That there are more people than you think who suffer from this.</li>
<li>How to help others who struggle with this.</li>
<li>Resources on how to deal with this/overcome this.</li>
<li>Why you shouldn't pin everything on 'luck'.</li>
</ol>
