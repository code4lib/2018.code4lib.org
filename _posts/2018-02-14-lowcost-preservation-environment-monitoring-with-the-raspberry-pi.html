title: Low-Cost Preservation Environment Monitoring with the Raspberry Pi
---
<p>
Controlling environmental conditions is an important tool used in preserving archives and manuscripts; in combination with HVAC systems, independent devices called preservation environment monitors (PEMs) are used to log data such as temperature and relative humidity.  This talk will detail the presenter’s construction of a do-it-yourself (DIY) PEM—using the Raspberry Pi—and compare its performance against a popular, but expensive, commercial PEM device.
