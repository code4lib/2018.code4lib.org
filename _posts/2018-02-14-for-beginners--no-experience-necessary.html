title: For Beginners -- No Experience Necessary
---
<p>
  You are attending - or teaching - a workshop on the latest tech hotness. The ad said it was "For Beginners -- No Experience Necessary". You get there and a third of the attendees don't have the right equipment and software, a third are on the verge of tears, and a third are bored out of their minds. What's worse, the presenters want to sneak out the back door. Attendees suck at self-selecting for these workshops because people suck at teaching for beginners. We need to be better at understanding what it means to teach for true beginners and at communicating the real expectations for attendees. This presentation will cover some ideas to get us on the right path for better experiences teaching and learning about technology.
