<p>
  In 2016 the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, in cooperation with the Smithsonian Office of the Chief Information Officer, embarked on a project to develop an online streaming video player capable of delivering audiovisual assets from 19 Smithsonian museum collections to the public. This talk will provide insights into the building of a new streaming player while integrating it with a pre-exisiting digital repository, highlighting the successes and failures in systems coordination for the world's largest museum.
