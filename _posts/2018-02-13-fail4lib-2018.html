We all face failure in our professional lives, but no one likes to talk about it. Our relationship with failure frequently comes hand in hand with embarrassment, fear, and taboo. But failure has intrinsic value and is an essential step on the path to professional success. And since it's inevitable, we ought to learn how to face failure, how to talk about it as professionals, and how to grow from it. Fail4Lib, now in its 6th year, is the perennial Code4Lib preconference dedicated to discussing and coming to terms with the failures that we all encounter in our professional lives. It is a safe space for us to explore failure, to talk about our own experiences with failure, and to encourage enlightened risk taking. The goal of Fail4Lib is for participants -- and their organizations -- to get better at failing gracefully, so that when we do fail, we do so in a way that moves us forward. This half-day preconference will consist of case studies, round-table discussions, and, for those interested in sharing, lightning talks on failures we've dealt with in our own work.
