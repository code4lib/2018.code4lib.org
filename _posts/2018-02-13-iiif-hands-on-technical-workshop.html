<p>Description</p>
<p>The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is a set of technical specifications built around shared challenges in cultural heritage access. This technical workshop will provide an overview of the IIIF specifications and hands-on exercises to gain a deeper understanding of the current landscape of tools and concepts. </p>

<p>What you will learn</p>
<p>Participants will explore the core Image and Presentation APIs, take a close look at various IIIF viewers, and get a brief introduction to the Content Search and Authentication APIs. Participants will also have an opportunity to discuss their institution's use cases and appropriate solutions, see some examples of use beyond the standard image viewers/tools, and receive pointers for how to go further and engage with the community.</p>

<p>Workshop attendees do not need any prior experience with IIIF and all technical skill levels are welcome. Requires some setup prior to the workshop to make the day start smoothly, and advance instructions and help will be provided.</p>
