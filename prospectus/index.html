           The Code4Lib 2018 Conference presents an opportunity for vendors, organizations, libraries,
           and projects to show their support for open and collaborative solutions for higher education,
           libraries, museums, and archives by providing financial support and attending the conference.
        </p>

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          We are a community of developers and technologists for galleries, libraries, museums, and
          archives. Code4Lib began as a simple mailing list in 2003, and has grown to become a vibrant
          community of more than 3,500.
        </p>

        <p>
          Code4Lib is a community, not an organization. There are no officers or by-laws, but the community has demonstrated:
          <ul>
            <li>openness and collaboration</li>
            <li>diversity and inclusiveness</li>
            <li>technical excellence</li>
            <li>a supportive and nurturing space for newcomers</li>
          </ul>
          Code4Lib is dedicated to these principles.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Conference</h2>
        <p>
          Each year, the Code4Lib Conference helps revitalize the community as participants meet in person
          to discuss new and ongoing projects in a single-track format with short presentations and talks.
          It also provides in-depth participatory learning experiences through its volunteer-led
          pre-conference programs, and offers ad-hoc breakout sessions focused on collaboration around
          topics of interest.
          <ul>
            <li>Conference speakers and programs are chosen by a voting process open to the entire community.</li>
            <li>Sessions are live-streamed to support remote attendance. Beginning in 2016, the stream was captioned in real-time to promote accessibility, and the community is committed to continuing this service.</li>
            <li>Scholarships help members of underrepresented communities attend the conference and take advantage of learning and networking opportunities. Many individual community members donate personally to increase the number of scholarships.</li>
            <li>Our single-track format promotes broad sharing of ideas; the 20-minute time limit for presentations allows topics on a wide variety of technologies.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Code4Lib held its first face-to-face meeting in 2005 in Chicago. The first official annual conference was held in 2006 in Corvallis, Oregon, with 150 attendees. Past conferences typically sell out quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
           The 2018 conference will accommodate up to 450 attendees. The conference is gender-diverse, with approximately 42% women attendees.
        </p>

        <h2>Impact of Support</h2>
        <p>
          Code4Lib offers a nexus for technical professionals from galleries, libraries, museums, and
          archives. Through sponsoring the conference, you can help create connections between projects
          and individuals, encourage good ideas to cross the gaps between subcommunities, and spawn new
          ideas. You can also help practitioners level up their skills — and not just technology skills,
          but also collaboration skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Code4Lib community takes inclusion and equity seriously. By sponsoring Code4Lib's diversity
          scholarships, you can help ensure that the attendees better represent the mix of people that
          galleries, libraries, museums, and archives technology should both embody and serve.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your sponsorship of the conference can also provide immediate, concrete benefits to you and your
          organization. Code4Lib attendees include practitioners who may be interested in your product,
          open source project, or services as well as department heads (15% of attendees last year) who may make purchases. Sponsors are strongly encouraged to send their staff to the conference to take advantage of access to the people
          and ideas who make up the Code4Lib community.
        </p>
