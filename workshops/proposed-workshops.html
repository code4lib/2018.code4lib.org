                    there are tools that make cleaning and standardizing data easier. This workshop's goals are to

                <p>Metadata is the driving force behind digital file management, but not everyone understands how
                    embedded metadata can be, or should be utilized to help with digital file management. Learn how you
                    can use file-naming conventions and specific tools such as Phil Harvey’s EXIFTool or Python scripts
                    to edit, apply, and manage metadata to large batches of files to facilitate asset discovery down the
                    road. We’ll also take a look at how you can read and write embedded metadata to digital files. These
                    embedded metadata exercises can be used to apply to a number of different goals such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Importing/exporting data to and from various systems (For example, integrating PIM/product
                        information management data with a DAM tool)
                    <li>Understanding the provenance of digital asset collections for audit
                    <li>Automating metadata application using standardized file-naming conventions
                    <li>Embedded Metadata Exercises
                    <li>View embedded metadata of digital files
                    <li>Edit embedded metadata on digital files
                    <li>Export embedded metadata from digital files to a CSV or TXT file
                    <li>Pair two exported metadata files (CSV) on a single key using Python
                    <li>Rename your files using embedded metadata
                    <li>Embedded Metadata Exercises in DAM Systems
                    <li>Mapping embedded metadata to a taxonomy
                    <li>Exporting embedded metadata from a system
                </ul>
                <p>And you’ll also learn some tips and tricks for when you might want to use embedded metadata, and
                    other cases where using embedded metadata is not the standard practice (such as on ecommerce
                    websites.)</p>

                    segments, provide descriptive analysis of each segment, order, re-order and compare different
                    segments from the same or different streams and create web sites that can show the result of your
                    analysis. In this workshop, I will use Omeka and several plugins I have developed for working with

                <p>We all face failure in our professional lives, but no one likes to talk about it. Our relationship
                    with failure frequently comes hand in hand with embarrassment, fear, and taboo. But failure has
                    intrinsic value and is an essential step on the path to professional success. And since it's
                    inevitable, we ought to learn how to face failure, how to talk about it as professionals, and how to
                    grow from it. Fail4Lib, now in its 6th year, is the perennial Code4Lib preconference dedicated to
                    discussing and coming to terms with the failures that we all encounter in our professional lives. It
                    is a safe space for us to explore failure, to talk about our own experiences with failure, and to
                    encourage enlightened risk taking. The goal of Fail4Lib is for participants -- and their
                    organizations -- to get better at failing gracefully, so that when we do fail, we do so in a way
                    that moves us forward. This half-day preconference will consist of case studies, round-table
                    discussions, and, for those interested in sharing, lightning talks on failures we've dealt with in
                    our own work.</p>

                <p>Static website generators are tools used to build a website made up only of HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. Static websites, unlike dynamic sites built with tools like Drupal or WordPress, do not
                    use databases or server-side scripting languages. Static websites have a number of benefits over
                    dynamic sites, including reduced security vulnerabilities, simpler long-term maintenance, and easier
                    preservation.</p>
                <p>In this hands-on workshop, we’ll start by exploring static website generators, their components, some
                    of the different options available, and their benefits and disadvantages. Then, we’ll work on making
                    our own sites, and for those that would like to, get them online with GitHub pages. Familiarity with
                    HTML, git, and command line basics will be helpful but are not required.</p>

                    Those results inform design decisions through the lens of information architecture. This is

                    to demonstrate some of these limitations via a case study approach in order to highlight the need
                    for a robust toolkit of scraping tools and methodologies when collecting for archival and research
                    purposes. Then, we use practical, hands-on demonstrations to assist workshop participants in
                    developing their own robust toolkits for scraping the web.</p>

                    parts of your job. If this is a thing that feels familiar to you, come to this workshop! We’ll get
                    some group therapy in, I’ll tell you some sweet (read: terrifying) stories from my own professional

                    customize your Twitter bot and see it send tweets out into the world. Why learn Python? It’s a great
                    “gateway” language to programming. It’s commonly used, very human-readable, and especially suited to
                    text processing tasks you may come across in library work. Why bots? Bots work behind the scenes of
                    the web. They can tell us the weather forecast when we ask (hey Siri), they systematically fix
                    broken links on Wikipedia, they summarize financial data (Forbes), and on Twitter, whimsical bots
                    can add a little bit of fun to the Internet. (Our favorites include @JustToSayBot, @TwoHeadlines,
                    and @big_ben_clock.) By the end of this workshop, you will have a functional bot of your very own

                <p>Tech workshops pose two unique problems: finding skilled instructors for that content, and
                    instructing that content well. Library hosted workshops are often a primary educational resource for
                    solo learners, and many librarians utilize these workshops as a primary outreach platform. Tackling
                    these two issues together often makes the most sense for our limited resources. Whether a
                    programming language or software tool, learning tech to teach tech can be one of the best
                    motivations for learning that tech skill or tool, but equally important is to learn how to teach and
                    present tech well.</p>
                <p>This hands-on workshop will guide participants through developing their own learning plan, reviewing

                    outline of a workshop they would like to teach.</p>

                <p>Social media data represents a tremendous opportunity for memory institutions of all kinds, be they
                    large academic research libraries, or small community archives. Researchers from a broad swath of
                    disciplines have a great deal of interest in working with social media content, but they often lack
                    access to datasets or the technical skills needed to create them. Further, it is clear that social
                    media is already a crucial part of the historical record in areas ranging from events your local
                    community to national elections. But attempts to build archives of social media data are largely
                    nascent. This workshop will be both an introduction to collecting data from the APIs of social media
                    platforms, as well as a discussion of the roles of libraries and archives in that collecting.</p>
                <p>Assuming no prior experience, the workshop will begin with an explanation of how APIs operate. We
                    will then focus specifically on the Twitter API, as Twitter is of significant interest to
                    researchers and hosts an important segment of discourse. Through a combination of hands-on and
                    demos, we will gain experience with a number of tools that support collecting social media data
                    (e.g., Twarc, Social Feed Manager, DocNow, Twurl, and TAGS), as well as tools that enable sharing
                    social media datasets (e.g., Hydrator, TweetSets, and the Tweet ID Catalog).</p>
                <p>The workshop will then turn to a discussion of how to build a successful program enabling social
                    media collecting at your institution. This might cover a variety of topics including outreach to
                    campus researchers, collection development strategies, the relationship between social media
                    archiving and web archiving, and how to get involved with the social media archiving community. This
                    discussion will be framed by a focus on ethical considerations of social media data, including
                    privacy and responsible data sharing.</p>
                <p>Time permitting, we will provide a sampling of some approaches to social media data analysis,
                    including Twarc Utils and Jupyter Notebooks.</p>

                <p>Library-generated data related to space utilization, technology utilization, and other primary
                    services can be a main source of insight into the current state of operations. However, if trapped
                    in spreadsheets and on server logs, the data is difficult to evaluate, and often remains
                    unevaluated. Web-based data dashboards provide a platform independent way of incorporating this data
                    into a near realtime visual summary.</p>
                <p>In this hands on workshop we will utilize the web framework Angular and the visualization library
                    D3.js to walk participants through the creation of a sample data dashboard application. Benefits of
                    using the Angular framework include reusable components, two-way data binding, and access to command
                    line tools which simplify code generation. D3.js provides a feature-rich library for crafting
                    personalized and modular visualizations.</p>
                <p>This sample application will highlight the best of both of these tools. When used together, they
                    create a dynamic, interactive data dashboard that could be used to display a wide variety of
                    relevant institutional metrics. While designed as a brief overview of both of these tools, previous
                    experience with JavaScript would be helpful.</p>

                <p>This is an introductory workshop to Solr, the fast and open source search platform that powers a lot
                    of library products. This workshop is geared to anyone that has never used Solr or uses it but has
                    not looked under the hood to see how it can be configured or explored some of the features that Solr
                    offers out of the box.</p>
                <p>We'll start the workshop with a quick review on how Solr stores data and the process that it goes
                    when a search is submitted.</p>
                <p>We'll then go through a tour of the main features in Solr:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indexing: where all of it starts</li>
                    <li>How to configure fields for different needs (ever wonder what does the &quot;_t&quot; means in a
                        Solr field and how is it different from a &quot;_s&quot; field?)
                    </li>
                    <li>What are Search Request Handlers</li>
                    <li>What do the different parses do (even been puzzled by dismax vs edismax?)</li>
                    <li>What's the difference between the &quot;q&quot; and &quot;fq&quot; parameters when you search
                    </li>
                    <li>How to use facets, synonyms, and hit highlighting</li>
                    <li>How tweak the ranking of results</li>
                    <li>What are local parameters</li>
                    <li>How to configure search term suggestions</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>How to configure replication (it's easy) and how you can use it</p>
                        <p>While practical, this workshop does not require you to be a coder. The idea is for you to
                            learn the concepts, features, and how they work. If you choose, we'll show you how to
                            install Solr on your machine to experiment with the concepts as we go. But if you prefer not
                            to install Solr (of updating configuration files is not your thing) you can still follow
                            along and learn with us.</p>

                    manipulating linked-data using the BIBFRAME RDF vocabulary in building cataloging and bibliographic
                    applications. Other topics include mapping BIBFRAME to Schema.org for search engine indexing and the

                <p>Libraries must ensure that users of all abilities can successfully use the technologies we provide.
                    Despite the many ethical and legal motivations, not all of our technologies meet accessibility

                <p>This workshop provides a foundation of skills and knowledge for becoming an accessibility advocate

                    should be concerned with making those dynamic elements accessible and usable to as many as possible.
                    One of the most powerful tools currently available for making web pages accessible is ARIA, the
                    Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification. This workshop will teach you the basics for

                    for a variety of different dynamic web elements. Topics will include semantic HTML, ARIA landmarks
                    and roles, expanding/collapsing content, and modal dialog. Participants will also be taught some
                    basic use of the screen reader NVDA for use in accessibility testing. Finally, the lessons will also

                    from core code, and moves that core code into containers that are easily updated, simplifying and
                    largely automating the process of installation and updates/maintenance of Islandora. ISLE also

                    For institutions considering migrating from a proprietary digital repository to a Fedora-based open

                    "Hydra in a Box." For institutions already using Islandora, ISLE is expected to cut maintenance
                    costs in half. This workshop will provide a thorough walkthrough of the project and system usage,
                    providing sufficient information for non-technical participants to make an informed decision about

                    around shared challenges in cultural heritage access. This technical workshop will provide an
                    overview of the IIIF specifications and hands-on exercises to gain a deeper understanding of the
                    current landscape of tools and concepts.</p>
                <p>Participants will explore the core Image and Presentation APIs, take a close look at various IIIF
                    viewers, and get a brief introduction to the Content Search and Authentication APIs. Participants
                    will also have an opportunity to discuss their institution's use cases and appropriate solutions,
                    see some examples of use beyond the standard image viewers/tools, and receive pointers for how to go
                    further and engage with the community.</p>
