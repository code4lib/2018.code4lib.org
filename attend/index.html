                    <li>
                        The registration system maintains a two hour session per registration
                        attempt. Due to the potential of heavy access and this prolonged session,
                        the conference may appear to sell out quickly. But once early failed
                        sessions expire, more spots may open up beginning around 2 p.m. Because of
                        this we ask you not to assume it is sold out until you hear an announcement
                        from the planning committee.

                    <li>
                        Registration will close when the maximum capacity has been reached.
                        A waitlist will be available once this final round of registration is
                        closed.
