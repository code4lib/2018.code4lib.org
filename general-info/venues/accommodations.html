        <p>The Code4Lib community aims to make the conference accessible for Attendees of all abilities.</p>

        <h3>Accommodation Requests</h3>
        <p>
            When registering, attendees were asked to include any accessibility needs
            they might require. We are doing our best to meet these needs. Everyone is
            encouraged to contact the accessibility committee if they have
            questions or new accommodation needs arise. The accessibility committee may
            be contacted by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <!--<li>Mailing <a href="mailto:code4lib@library.ucla.edu">code4lib@library.ucla.edu</a></li>-->
            <li>Talking with a volunteer at the registration desk who will forward the request</li>
            <li>Asking for help from a <a href="/conduct/#officers">duty officer</a></li>
        </ul>
        <!--<p>
            For inquiries about accessible parking and transportation, we recommend talking
            with the <a href="http://luskinconferencecenter.ucla.edu/">Luskin Center</a> directly.
