            <h2>Accessibility Instructions for Presenters</h2>
            <p>
                All presenters should please review these accessibility requirements and presentation logistics. Make note
                of the four action items for your talk(s).
            </p>

            <h3>Action 1: PC/Mac Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
                Ensure that your slides will display correctly on BOTH Mac and PC.
                There will be a presenter laptop at the podium to streamline transitions
                and minimize tech issues. We don’t yet know if it will be a Mac or a PC.
                If you absolutely need to use your own laptop (e.g. a demo that only
                works on your machine), please let your Program Committee Liaison know ASAP.
            </p>

            <h3>Action 2: Submit Slides Early for Supporting Live Captioning</h3>
            <p>
                Code4Lib 2018 will feature live captioning during the three days of the
                general conference. In order to improve the quality of this service, we
                ask presenters to send their slides to us so that the captioners can use
                them as reference and improve the quality of the live text stream.
            </p>
            <!--<p>
                Please submit your slides to Aaron Collier
                (<a href="mailto:acollier@calstate.edu?Subject=Code4Lib%20Slides">acollier@calstate.edu</a>)
                at least 24 hours before your presentation (the earlier the better).
            </p>-->
            <p>
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> You can continue to edit and change your slides
                after submission. You do not need to resubmit any changes unless you
                feel you added any difficult words or terms that would be challenging
                for live captioning. Keep in mind that the captioners may not have domain
                expertise in libraries.
            </p>

            <h3>Action 3: Design a Visually Accessible Presentation</h3>
            <p>
                Presenters are encouraged to use the following guidelines to ensure that
                their presentations are visually accessible to attendees.
            </p>
            <h4>Fonts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid fonts that use thin strokes in the characters.</li>
                <li>Choose readable sans serif or serif fonts. Generally avoid script or monospaced fonts.</li>
                <li>
                    Suggested fonts include: Helvetica and its clones (Arial, Calibri,
                    etc.), Gill Sans, Comic Sans (seriously!), Verdana, Franklin Gothic,
                    Rockwell, Tahoma, Lucida, and Times New Roman.
                </li>
                <li>Use underlining, italics, and boldface sparingly.</li>
                <li>
                    Aim for a font size of 20-30 point. Generally, do not go below
                    18-point for slide content (if you plan to share your slides
                    with the community, it’s okay to use smaller fonts for references
                    and URIs).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Colors</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Choose text and background colors that have good contrast. You can
                    use a <a href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">contrast
                    checker</a> to check for good constrast. The web accessibility thresholds
                    are not relevant to slide presentations, but higher contrast is still better.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For color blindness considerations, add patterns or labels in graphs and charts.
                    This is especially important if are using either red-green or yellow-blue
                    color combinations. These are the two most common types of color blindness.
                    If you are uncertain about a color choice, a <a href="http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/">color
                    blindness simulator</a> may help.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Videos/Animations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid blinking text and animations that endlessly repeat.</li>
                <li>
                    If your presentation features lots of animations, videos, etc.,
                    please include a warning at the start of your talk. This is especially
                    needed if any contain lots of flicker.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a video contains sound or dialogue, please try to use a version
                    with captioning.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Sharing Slides</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Participants are encouraged to share their slides. If placed on the
                    web, please include a short link in your opening slides for attendees
                    to view on their personal machines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Include speaker notes with your files if the file format allows.
                    In particular, describe any images, tables, charts, etc. in the notes.
                </li>
