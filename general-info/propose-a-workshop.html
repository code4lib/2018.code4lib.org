                The pre-conference sessions give folks a space to share and build knowledge, as well as to teach
                attendees new skills relevant to library technology. Preconference sessions can range from workshops
                to working sessions, and we welcome a variety of ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're looking for inspiration, there are many great examples of pre-conferences from previous years.
