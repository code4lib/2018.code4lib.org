                    Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens another person or group, or produces an unsafe
                    environment. It includes offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender
                    identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age,
                    religious beliefs, sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces (including online), deliberate
                    intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or
                    other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
